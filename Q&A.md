# Questions and Answers related to C-19 (ncov).

- What kind of virus is it?
- What other species apart from humans does it infect (mammals, birds)?
- What are its cousins (e.g., SARS, MERS)?
- What are all the symptoms?
- What is the progression of symptoms (broken down by age)?
- How does it spread? (e.g., via droplets and surfaces)
- How long can it survive on surfaces?
- How rapidly does it spread (virulence, Umea research, etc)?
- Where did it originate?
- A table of countires, # of infected, # of deaths, # of severe cases broken down by age, gender, nationality, underlying condition?
- Is there a pattern in the death rates? What are the most vulnerable populations?
- Is the mortality rate and severity consistent across all countries?
- When and where was the first documented case?
- What is the rate of reinfection? What is the severity of reinfection (mortality rate, etc)?
- Why are children and younger adults asymptomatic and are not as affected as older populations?
- How long does it take for symptoms to appear from the time of infection?
- What is the co-pathogenesis (what underlying conditions are worst)?
- How quickly does it progress from first symptoms to severe ones? What fraction of cases results in severe ones?

## Genetics & Biochemistry
- Which of the host cells have similar receptors as c19 (S-proteins)?
- What causes RBD to switch from down to up?
- What are the sites of attack (on c19 and host cells)? Are they the same across all species?
- How similar is its shell to SARS and MERS?


## Testing
- How is c19 treated?


## Treatment
- What currently available drugs are effective against it?
- How about a pneumonia vaccine (if most people get pneumonia)?
- What is the optimum number of ICU per population at different virulence rates?
